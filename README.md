## **Introduction**

Operating systems are a crucial part of modern computing, responsible for resource management, process scheduling, and ensuring efficient communication between hardware and software. This repository provides simple and clear implementations of key algorithms, making it easier to grasp their functionality through code.

## **Features**

The repository includes implementations of the following algorithms:

### 1. CPU Scheduling Algorithms:
   - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
   - Shortest Job First (SJF)
   - Round Robin (RR)
   - Priority Scheduling
### 2. Deadlock Handling:
   - Basic implementation of deadlock detection and prevention.
### 3. Memory Management:
   - Best Fit, Worst Fit, and First Fit memory partitioning algorithms.
### 4. Page Replacement:
   - Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement algorithm.
### 5. Disk Scheduling:
   - FCFS (First Come First Serve)
   - SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
   - C-LOOK (Circular LOOK)
